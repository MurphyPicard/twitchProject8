# Ara's Twitch API Project


## Useful info:

USAGE:
Replace the Twitch API base URL https://api.twitch.tv/kraken with https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api. Use this endpoint according to the Twitch API documentation.

NOTE:
This server caches data to lower the request rate. To prevent abuses this server accepts GET requests only, and serves only routes /users/:user, /channels/:channel, and /streams/:stream. These are more than enough to complete the challenge.

PEOPLE WHO REGULARLY STREAM:
["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
